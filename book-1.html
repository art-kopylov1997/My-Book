                <h2 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</h2>
                In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of
                worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it
                was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. <br>

                It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the
                exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without
                smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and
                lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going
                fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles
                round called it - and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.
                No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he
                had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on
                the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones
                to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the
                river. <br>

                This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the
                neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only
                because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything
                unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.
                This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether
                unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained-well, you will see whether he gained
                anything in the end. <br>

                The mother of our particular hobbit. . . what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description
                nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a
                little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards.
                There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear
                quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like
                elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in
                bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles
                and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown
                fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have
                twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of
                this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable
                daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at
                the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must
                have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not
                entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have
                adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the
                Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna
                Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built
                the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The
                Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is
                probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his
                solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the Took side, something that
                only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being
                about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have
                just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably. <br>

                By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and
                more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his
                door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes
                (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about
                him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of
                remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most
                extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his
                friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been
                away over The Hill and across The Water on business of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and
                hobbit-girls. <br>

                All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue
                hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense
                black boots. "Good morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very
                green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of
                his shady hat. "What do you mean?" be said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good
                morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?"
                <br>

                "All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the
                bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all
                the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a
                beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The
                Hill. <br>

                "Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for
                someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone. " <br>

                I should think so - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty
                disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them, said
                our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring.
                Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old
                man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not
                move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got
                quite uncomfortable and even a little cross. <br>

                <h2 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</h2>
                In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. After a
                while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking:
                "Humph!" (or some snort more or less like that). "Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for
                Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would
                be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like
                fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we
                had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the
                mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!" <br>

                Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go
                without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made
                him really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to
                himself: "Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it. " <br>

                "Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't pretend to understand
                what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in believing" (this is
                what he called being on his dignity) "that you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on
                my door-it was painted a week ago-, and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I
                saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you
                want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild
                Were-worms in the Last Desert. I bad a great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and -" "Yes,
                yes, but that was long ago," said Gloin. "I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a mark on
                this door-the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and
                reasonable Reward, that's how it is usually read. You ^an say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar
                if you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort
                in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday
                tea-time. " <br>

                "Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me
                to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose
                the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go
                back to digging coal. " <br>

                He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open
                his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo
                shut his mouth tight with a snap. "That's right," said Gandalf. "Let's have no more argument. I have
                chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to !6te enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he
                is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he
                has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp,
                and let's have little light on this!" <br>

                On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of parchment rather like a
                map. <br>

                "This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' excited questions.
                "It is a plan of the Mountain. " "I don't see that this will help us much," said Thorin disappointedly
                after a glance. "I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood
                is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred. " <br>

                "There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain, said Balin, "but it will be easy enough to find him
                without that, if ever we arrive there. " "There is one point that you haven't noticed," said the wizard,
                "and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from
                the other runes? That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls. <br>

                <h2 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</h2>
                Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but
                all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of
                unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The
                washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not
                been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think
                that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up ("but with never a thank-you"
                he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling
                surprised him. <br>

                "Don't be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!" he said to himself, "thinking of dragons and all that outlandish
                nonsense at your age!" So be put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice
                little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was shining;
                and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to
                forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the
                dining-room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf. "My dear fellow," said he, "whenever are you
                going to come? What about an early start?-and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at
                half past ten! They left you the message, because they could not wait. " <br>

                That's how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before May, on laden
                ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark-green hood (a little weather-stained) and a dark-green cloak
                borrowed from Dwalin. They were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo
                would have thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as
                he had no beard. <br>

                They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. He had brought a
                lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo's pipe and tobacco. So after that the party went along very
                merrily, and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when they
                stopped for meals. These didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began
                to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. At first they had passed through hobbit-lands, a wild
                respectable country inhabited by decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf
                or a farmer ambling by on business. Then they came to lands where people spoke strangely, and sang songs
                Bilbo had never heard before. Now they had gone on far into the Lone-lands, where there were no people
                left, no inns, and the roads grew steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and
                higher, dark with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had been built
                by wicked people. Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it
                had been as good as May can be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-lands they
                had to camp when they could, but at least it had been dry. "To think it will soon be June," grumbled
                Bilbo as he splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track. It was after tea-time; it was
                pouring with rain, and had been all day; his hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of
                water; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. "And I'm sure the
                rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags," thought Bilbo. "Bother burgling and
                everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just
                beginning to sing!" It was not the last time that he wished that! Still the dwarves jogged on, never
                turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit. Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have
                gone down, for it began to get dark. Wind got up, and the willows along the river-bank bent and sighed.
                I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of the last few days, that
                came down from the hills and mountains in front of them. Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the
                grey clouds, and a waning moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and
                Thorin muttered something about supper, "and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?" Not until then
                did they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he
                was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. He had eaten most, talked most, and
                laughed most. But now he simply was not there at all! "Just when a wizard would have been most useful,
                too," groaned Dori and Nori (who shared the hobbit's views about regular meals, plenty and often). They
                decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. So far they had not camped before on
                this journey, and though they knew that they soon would have to camp regularly, when they were among the
                Misty Mountains and far from the lands of respectable people, it seemed a bad wet evening to begin, on.
                They moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the
                leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire.
                Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do
                it that night, not even Oin and Gloin, who were specially good at it. Then one of the ponies took fright
                at nothing and bolted. He got into the river before they could catch him; and before they could get him
                out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned, and all the baggage that he carried was washed away off
                him. Of course it was mostly food, and
                there was mighty little left for supper, and less for breakfast. There they all sat glum and wet and
                muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire, and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was
                sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-rides in May-sunshine, when Balin, who was always
                their look-out man, said: "There's a light over there!" There was a hill some way off with trees on it,
                pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they could now see a light shining, a reddish
                comfortable-looking light, as it might be a fire or torches twinkling. When they had looked at it for
                some while, they fell to arguing. Some said "no" and some said "yes. " Some said they could but go and
                see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night. Others
                said: "These parts are none too well known, and are too near the mountains. Travellers seldom come this
                way now. The old maps are no use: things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded. They have
                seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less
